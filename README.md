# cep-tracker-firebase

## Installation
* `git clone git@github.comverge.com:kgodard/cep-tracker-firebase.git`
* `cd cep-tracker-firebase`
* `bundle install`
* `cp my_settings.yml.example my_settings.yml`
* Add your name to the `my_settings.yml`
* Add the `firebase_secret` to the `my_settings.yml`
* `chmod +x ctf.rb`
* `bundle exec rake ctf_setup`
* `ctf -h` for options

## Usage
Type `ctf`. You will be prompted for the tracker story Id, the type of
event you wish to save, and a 'reason' (if needed).

If you want to specify some or all of these options rather than being
prompted, you can. Run `ctf -h` for details.

To specify a timestamp other than __now__, use the `-d` option. Example:

`ctf -t 123456789 -d '2016-03-17 16:20:00'`

## How to use
We want to track the time between when we click __start__ and when we click __finish__ for a story. So generally the flow is: we click __start__, we do the code, do the PR, do the stakeholder demo (if needed), then merge, then click __finish__.

So that's when we want to register the __finish__ event -- when we actually click "finish" in pivotal, and the story then passes out of our control and into QA's control.

### Stopping/starting events
If your story gets ​_blocked_​ for some reason, you want to register a __block__ event. When it becomes un-blocked, register a __resume__ event.

If you need to ​_stop_​ your story for some reason (i.e. you need to put it down because another story just became a super-high priority), register a __stop__ event. When you begin on it again, register a __resume__.

(Stop is meant to be a generic event for when we're not ​_blocked_​, but we still have to stop working on the story for some reason.)

### Reject events
Reject events are not meant for the time between start and finish. When you've finished a story, but it gets _rejected_ by QA, you want to register a __reject__ event for it. This allows us to track our "rejection rate".

If you _re-start_ a rejected story, register a __restart__ event for it.

### Pause/Play (optional events that won't be used in standard reporting)
Lastly, "pause" and "play". These are totally optional. If you want to get super-granular about tracking your time, you can use __pause__ and __play__ to briefly halt your story progress for small delays, like context-switching because of interruptions, etc. Note that I DON'T plan to include these events for our standard sprint reporting, and these events would only be taken into account if/when we start doing some other types of reporting besides our standard three (velocity, rejection rate, cycle time).

## Feedback
If you have questions, comments, concerns, let me know -- this thing is really an experiment, and it's definitely a work in progress.

## Contributions 
Feel free to add enhancements and/or fix bugs in __CTF__ -- just let everyone know if you want to add a feature so that we can generally agree on it, and let everyone know when you've pushed up changes to the master branch so we can `git pull`!
